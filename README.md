# Doxxy
A Discord bot to help guide users of the JDA library.

## Features
* Search docs (JDA & JDK 17), with support for partial matching:
  * Typing anything will search for classes and methods
  * Typing a class name, followed by a `#` and a name, will search for methods in a class
    * For example, `rest#comp` will give, among other results, `RestAction#complete()`
  * Constant fields can be searched by typing in all caps, like `Message#MAX_COMPONENT_CONUT`.
* Sending Maven/Gradle/Gradle KTS build scripts
* Sending Logback configurations
* Getting the latest versions and snapshots
* Sending user-created code examples
* Formatting code
* Tags
